				PHOTOGRAPHY I
					This is a basic course in the principles of black and white photography. Students see their world through the lens of a 35mm camera. Students will take photographs, process film, make proof sheets, choose images to enlarge, and manipulate prints through burning, dodging, and the use of filters. Students are involved in the critique process through group activities including Socratic seminars. Students analyze, interpret and make informed judgments of works of art. Preparing prints for presentation will include spotting, dry mounting and matting. In addition, the history of photography will be introduced through slide lectures, research, and small group discussion. A limited number of cameras are available for student use.
				CERAMICS
					This is a beginning level course in hand building and throwing. Students explore basic  theory and  techniques to form creative and functional ceramic objects. Kiln firing and glaze applications are covered. The use of the potterâ€˜s wheel is introduced. The history of ceramics is studied through research and group activities. Oral and written critiques are part of all projects.
				WEIGHT TRAINING
					The Weight Training and Conditioning course is a standards based class that is worth elective credits. Students will improve their health and physical fitness as it relates to their desired goal of overall health &/or competitive purposes.  Students in Course 3 (10th-12th) will have the opportunity to develop and improve their fitness and conditioning levels through the means of flexibility, weight training, Plyometric, aquatic, and cardiovascular based training. Students will learn these through instruction, observation, demonstration and participation. This Course will also support the Common Core State Standards for the Reading Standards for Literacy in Science and Technical Subjects 6-12.
				AP COMPUTER SCIENCE
					AP Computer Science A is a yearlong course designed to introduce students to programming concepts leading to topics designated for AP exam. Students will be working with the JAVA programming language.  The curriculum for the AP Computer Science A course includes all topics and the course descriptions for AP Computer Science A as described by the College Board.  This course concentrates on building a strong logic foundation, working with data structures, and implementing object-oriented designs.  All students are encouraged to take the AP exam.
