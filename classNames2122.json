Placement in special education is determined at an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting.The Special Education Department provides services to students with challenges that impede their learning in the general education environment. There are four levels of the special education programs based on student eligibility. Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI)of 50% or less, Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) of 50% or more, Functional Life Skills, and Medically Fragile. In an on-going effort to better serve students' needs, meet state and federal mandates for a least restrictive environment, and support learning based on student challenges and abilities, students often see more than one teacher within the department.SAI Learning Skills:Based on eligibility and IEP Team decision, these students who need additional academic support receive assistance from their general education class work through one daily period of a Learning Skills support class. These students may also be enrolled in an academic subject area special education class, per their IEP.SAI Study Skills:Based on eligibility and IEP Team decision, specialized modified academic instruction classes are available for students who need more intensive support in academic areas or a smaller group setting, generally for three to four periods per day. Students are mainstreamed for electives and physical education.SAI Functional Life Skills Program:This SDC program focuses on life skills for students with cognitive deficits. The class is a self-contained class for 4-5 periods a day, with opportunities for community-based learning, plus an off-campus vocational /work experience component through ROP.SAI Medically Fragile: This program is designed to meet the needs of the students with the most significant disabilities. The high staff to student ratio provides intensive personal attention and the opportunity for students to develop skills and enhance independence.Crossroads Independent Study:This independent study program offers academic, vocational and career/job training for special education students who do not fit the traditional academic six period day schedule. Special education students who have life and/or family issues, which preclude them from full participation within a typical high school setting, may be considered for this program through a decision made by the IEP team.Social Cognitive/Behavioral Services: These program services address either social and/or personal behaviors that are adversely affecting student learning, and are determined/designated by the IEP Team.Workability Iis available to all special education students for work opportunities and vocational exploration.Speech/Language Serviceswhich address identified communication challenges are available per students' IEPs.Spanish IICourse Comparison Information Sheet<a id=\"t.9f180c709143370c9887d6ee5292a0af7e2c25cf\"></a><a id=\"t.163\"></a><table class=\"c138\"><tbody><tr class=\"c189\"><td class=\"c237\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Spanish II</td><td class=\"c237\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Spanish II Honors</td></tr><tr class=\"c12\"><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Considerations<ul class=\"c26 lst-kix_mwt7ub2z1ciq-0 start\"><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-7\">Class is taught primarily in Spanish although English will be spoken at times</li><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Students are expected to speak in Spanish when instructed by the teacher</li><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Students are encouraged to speak in Spanish as much as possible and participate frequently</li><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Same textbook and online resources are used in both levels</li></ul></td><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Considerations<ul class=\"c26 lst-kix_4i6eqc9nqojw-0 start\"><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Strongly recommended for students who plan to take Spanish IIIH </li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">The pace of Spanish II honors is faster </li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">The content/concepts are more in depth</li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Students will gain higher levels of fluency</li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Class is taught entirely in Spanish</li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Students are expected to speak Spanish during class and participate frequently</li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Same textbook and online resources are used in both levels</li></ul></td></tr><tr class=\"c12\"><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></td></tr><tr class=\"c12\"><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Assessment<ul class=\"c26 lst-kix_rhw0mfr10u0s-0 start\"><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Students are evaluated on the four major skills: reading, writing, speaking and listening in the three modes of communication</li><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Emphasis is on what students can do with the language rather than how much they know about the language</li><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Students have multiple opportunities to reach/demonstrate proficiency</li></ul></td><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Assessment<ul class=\"c26 lst-kix_eza297xgoelf-0 start\"><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-7\">Students are evaluated on the four major skills: reading, writing, speaking and listening in the three modes of communication</li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Emphasis is on what students can do with the language rather than how much they know about the language</li><li class=\"c1 c198 c97 li-bullet-0\">Students have multiple opportunities to reach/demonstrate proficiency</li></ul></td></tr><tr class=\"c12\"><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Homework<ul class=\"c26 lst-kix_jqw13kefu3lb-0 start\"><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">Approximately 15 - 30 minutes daily </li><li class=\"c1 c37 li-bullet-0\">May include:</li></ul>Exercises from online textbookWriting activitiesReviewing and studyingTest preparationProjectsInternet activities</td><td class=\"c130\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Homework<ul class=\"c26 lst-kix_nhcte31zskfr-0 start\"><li class=\"c1 c46 li-bullet-0\">Approximately 15 - 30 minutes daily </li><li class=\"c1 c46 li-bullet-0\">May include:</li></ul>Exercises from online textbookWriting activitiesReviewing and studyingTest preparationReading articles onlineInternet activities</td></tr></tbody></table>"
